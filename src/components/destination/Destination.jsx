        text="Taal Volcano is an active stratovolcano situated on Luzon Island,
        approximately 50 kilometers south of Manila. What makes Taal Volcano
        unique is its location within Taal Lake, forming an island within a
        lake, within an islandâ€”a geological phenomenon known as a nested
        caldera. This intricate structure has earned Taal the distinction of
        being one of the world's smallest active volcanoes."
